# Project Notes

## Improvements

### Component Architecture & Organization

**Modular Component Structure**
- Restructure the component directory into feature-based subdirectories (e.g., `dashboard/`, `products/`, `charts/`, `forms/`) to improve maintainability and scalability as the project grows
- Break down larger components into smaller, focused components following the Single Responsibility Principle for better testability, reusability, and maintainability

### Data Visualization Enhancements

**Interactive Chart Options**
- Implement multiple chart type options for the trend visualization (line charts, bar charts, area charts, pie charts) allowing users to select the most appropriate view for their data analysis needs

**Export Capabilities**
- Add comprehensive export functionality for both chart visualizations and table data, supporting multiple formats (PNG/SVG for charts, CSV/Excel/PDF for tables) to enable users to share insights and create reports outside the application

These improvements would enhance the user experience, improve code maintainability, and provide greater flexibility for data analysis and reporting workflows.
